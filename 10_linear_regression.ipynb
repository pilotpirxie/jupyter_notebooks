    "Supervised learning - algorithms are trained using labeled examples with known output\n",
    "e.g. spam vs legit emails\n",
    "positive vs negative movie review\n",
    "\n",
    "The network receives a set of inputs along with the corresponding correct outputs\n",
    "then \"learns\" by comparing its actual output with correct outputs to find errors.\n",
    "It then modifies the model accordingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Process:\n",
    "Data acquisition -> Data cleaning -> Test data & Model training and building -> Model testing -> Deploy model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data is often split into 3 sets:\n",
    "Training Data - to train model parameters\n",
    "Validation Data - to determine what model heperparameters to adjust\n",
    "Test Data - to get final performance metric\n",
    "\n",
    "This means, after we see the results on the **final test** we don't get to back and adjust any model parameters.\n",

    "### Classification metrics:\n",
    "* accuracy\n",
    "* recall\n",
    "* precision\n",
    "* f1-score\n",

    "Typical model can be correct in its prediction or incorrect."
